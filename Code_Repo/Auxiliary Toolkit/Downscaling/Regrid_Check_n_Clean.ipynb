    "This is the post-CDO regridding process that that identifies which files were not regridded or failed due to various reasons and provides some means for helping to fix that. This is the most chaotic of notebooks the sFWRD database as it really is a back of the napkin, fix what needs to be fixed, and send it back through CDO process. The processes used here might not solve problems that arose personally during the gridding process but may help identify a solution path.\n",
